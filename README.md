You need to have a shortcut of the dataset folder in the "My Drive" section renamed to "HxD_dataset" (or else you need to change the name in the code to read and unzip the folder), make sure you're using the same google account for accessing **colab**
Make Sure you allow the third party cookies to the colab site or to overall chrome  (in setting > Privacy and Security > Third Party Cookies )
Run the first block and continue with your google account, and in the seconf tab make sure to select all before continuing!!
